# Breast Cancer Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates how to predict breast cancer using Logistic Regression in Python.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.

## Methodology

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the dataset using Pandas.
   - Handle missing values.
   - Encode categorical features using Label Encoding.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Scale the features using StandardScaler.

2. **Model Training:**
   - Train a Logistic Regression model using the training data.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Predict the target variable for the testing data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Results

The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy score here]. The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the model's performance.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn

## Usage

1. Install the required dependencies.
2. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate the model.
